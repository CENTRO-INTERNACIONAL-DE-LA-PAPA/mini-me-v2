# Spec Delta

## MODIFIED Requirements

### Requirement: Kinds of Interactive Components
Each Interactive Component kind SHALL be hand-coded in the UI, with a kebab-case `kind` name
and a renderer for each of its versions (positive integers). Component data SHALL come only
from a Trait's adapter through the kind's show tool, or, for the `approval`, `document-edits`
and `hand-off` kinds, from the Rust core; the Rust core SHALL complete a `suggestion`'s data
with the passage it is based on. Adding a kind SHALL NOT need a change to the event protocol,
the link protocol or the Project database.

#### Scenario: Kinds in this version
- **WHEN** the app starts
- **THEN** the UI renders `paper-sources` version 1, `theories` version 1, `table`
  version 1, `approval` version 1, `chart` version 1, `document` version 1, `suggestion`
  version 1, `document-edits` version 1, `hand-off` version 1 and `dataset-results` version 1

#### Scenario: Every listed kind is rendered
- **WHEN** the app is built
- **THEN** every kind that a show tool adds has a renderer for version 1

#### Scenario: No Trait adds an approval
- **WHEN** a Trait call sends `component.add` with kind `approval`
- **THEN** the request fails with `component_not_allowed`

#### Scenario: No Trait adds document edits
- **WHEN** a Trait call sends `component.add` with kind `document-edits`
- **THEN** the request fails with `component_not_allowed`

#### Scenario: No Trait adds a hand-off
- **WHEN** a Trait call sends `component.add` with kind `hand-off`
- **THEN** the request fails with `component_not_allowed`
